# Reken Quiz


## Tasks
---

- [x] Allow each rule to specify the number of equations, show the total in the current Quantity box. Equations should still be mixed
- [x] Allow rule blocks (field sets) to be collaped/opened
- [x] Allow entire rules to be toggled on/off, e.g. toggle addition off but leave subtraction on before generating. Toggled off rules should be collapsed and all fields disabled until toggled back on.
- [x] In print mode, show the enabled rules (addition, subtraction etc) as a list. Omit rules that have been disabled
- [x] Update the selection for digits to have Single, Double and Any as options
- [x] Update the selection for Hidden to have Answer, Left Operand, Right Operand and Random as options
- [x] Toggling Single for digits should only change one of the operands to single digit. This should also account for hidden operands.
- [ ] Align the beginning of all equations and take the numbering before the equations into account.
- [ ] Selecting Subtraction with up to 20 and double digits makes all equations start with 20. This is not correct and needs to be fixed.
