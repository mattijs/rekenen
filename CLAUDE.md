## Package Management

- Use `pnpm` for managing packages
- Add packages to `devDependencies` by default
- Only add packages to `dependencies` if they are compiled and shipped to the browser

## Tasks

- Tasks are described in the README.md file under the `## Tasks` heading
- Once a task is confirmed by the user to be done it should be removed
